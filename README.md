# Adaptive-MLP

Given some example data, this constructs an MLP with 1 hidden layer. The learning function was inspired by mlforanalytics (https://mlforanalytics.com/2018/05/08/multi-layer-perceptron-using-python/).

In summary, this is a simple MLP written with python and numpy, and there is not much else to it!
